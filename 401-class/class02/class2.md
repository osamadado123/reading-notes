# In Tests We Trust — TDD with Python

Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

but we have something called TDD (Test-Driven Development)
its like a strategy to think and write you should always walk in baby steps because when you try to skip some stuff its always so expensive and time consuming later for testing and debugging the later you do it the worse it gets so you should test step by step

# What does the if \_\_name\_\_ == “\_\_main\_\_”: do?

it basically limits the imported code when you import from one script to another for example you want specific lines to be imported from that one script you use  \_\_name\_\_ == "\\__main\_\_" to exclude the line underneath it 

# Introduction to Recursion

what is Recursion its when a function calls itself directly or indirectly, the corresponding function is called a recursive function.

recursion is really good to make your code easier to read and understand also less lines and it really helps with iteration when you have too many of them 

the simplest example for recursion is the factorial of a number
