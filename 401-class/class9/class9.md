# What is the data structure

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways. Most importantly, data structures frame the organization of information so that machines and humans can better understand it.

# Why are data structures important?

Typical base data types, such as integers or floating-point values, that are available in most computer programming languages are generally insufficient to capture the logical intent for data processing and use.

# Five factors to consider when picking a data structure include the following:

- What kind of information will be stored?
- How will that information be used?
- Where should data persist, or be kept, after it is created?
- What is the best way to organize the data?
- What aspects of memory and storage reservation management should be considered?

# How are data structures used?
In general, data structures are used to implement the physical forms of abstract data types. Data structures are a crucial part of designing efficient software. They also play a critical role in algorithm design and how those algorithms are used within computer programs.

## Some examples
- Storing data.
- Managing resources and services.
- Data exchange.
- Ordering and sorting.
- Indexing.
- Searching.
- Scalability.

# What is LinkedList

## Linked List Representation
Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where every node points to the next node.

the important points to be considered.

- Linked List contains a link element called first.

- Each link carries a data field(s) and a link field called next.

- Each link is linked with its next link using its next link.

- Last link carries a link as null to mark the end of the list.

## Types of Linked List

- **Simple Linked List** − Item navigation is forward only.

- **Doubly Linked List** − Items can be navigated forward and backward.

- **Circular Linked List** − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.

## Basic Operations

- Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

- Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

- Display − Displays the complete list.

- Search − Searches an element using the given key.

- Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.
