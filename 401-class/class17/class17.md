# Regular Expressions
often shortened as regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not. If you've ever used search engines, search and replace tools of word processors and text editors - you've already seen regular expressions in use. They are used at the server side to validate the format of email addresses or passwords during registration, used for parsing text data files to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc. They help in manipulating textual data, which is often a prerequisite for data science projects involving text mining.

# Regular Expressions in Python
In Python, regular expressions are supported by the re module. That means that if you want to start using them in your Python scripts, you have to import this module with the help of import:

`import re`

The re library in Python provides several functions that make it a skill worth mastering. You will see some of them closely in this tutorial.

# shutil
## Copying Files
copyfile() copies the contents of the source to the destination and raises IOError if it does not have permission to write to the destination file.

```
import glob
import shutil

print('BEFORE:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))

shutil.copyfile('shutil_copyfile.py', 'shutil_copyfile.py.copy')

print('AFTER:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))
```

## Copying File Metadata
By default when a new file is created under Unix, it receives permissions based on the umask of the current user. To copy the permissions from one file to another, use copymode().

```
import os
import shutil
import subprocess

with open('file_to_change.txt', 'wt') as f:
    f.write('content')
os.chmod('file_to_change.txt', 0o444)

print('BEFORE:', oct(os.stat('file_to_change.txt').st_mode))

shutil.copymode('shutil_copymode.py', 'file_to_change.txt')

print('AFTER :', oct(os.stat('file_to_change.txt').st_mode))
```
## Working With Directory Trees
shutil includes three functions for working with directory trees. To copy a directory from one place to another, use copytree(). It recurses through the source directory tree, copying files to the destination. The destination directory must not exist in advance.

```
import glob
import pprint
import shutil

print('BEFORE:')
pprint.pprint(glob.glob('/tmp/example/*'))

shutil.copytree('../shutil', '/tmp/example')

print('\nAFTER:')
pprint.pprint(glob.glob('/tmp/example/*'))
```

## Finding Files
The which() function scans a search path looking for a named file. The typical use case is to find an executable program on the shellâ€™s search path defined in the environment variable PATH.
```
import shutil

print(shutil.which('virtualenv'))
print(shutil.which('tox'))
print(shutil.which('no-such-program'))
```
